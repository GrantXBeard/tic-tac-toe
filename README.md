- Write clean/DRY Javascript
- Understanding the difference between the data model and the DOM and keeping them separate
- Iterate through DOM elements using for loops
- Using problem solving to break down large problems and logical challenges

## Technologies

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Project Specs

- The project spec & rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html)

## Challenges/wins

Wins: Some bigger wins for me in this project were successfully keeping the DOM and data model separate and utilizing SRP

Challenges: The logic for checking winning conditions was especially challenging

## Future Iterations

- Local storage to make current game scores persist across refreshes
- Animations for gameplay
